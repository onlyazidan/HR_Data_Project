RECOMMENDATION
1.	While the organisation commends and rewards the highest performance department, the department with the lowest performance rate should be looked into to increase their performance.
2.	Although the employees are from all age groups the organisation should give room for more employees between 45 years and above, not just to balance the workforce but to improve diversity in each employee’s contribution to the organisation.
3.	The average monthly income shows that although the R&D department has the highest performance rating, their average monthly income is the lowest. So, the monthly income should be reviewed to balance the performance rate.
